README of turtlebot_visual_servoing ROS package : a turtlebot line tracker based on ROS, Visp and OpenCV.

Objectif :
In this project we have this situation: two turtlebots linked by a passive orange rope. The goal is to make the second turtlebot follow the leader, which will be controlled by a joystick. The follower turtlebot will use its VGA camera as its only sensor and it should be guided only by the rope orientation and shape. It should keep a regular distance from the leader so that the rope is not completely slack nor tight.
